## Dev

This app is only developed and tested on Android. Also, expect some issues if [MWA](https://docs.solanamobile.com/developers/mobile-wallet-adapter) is not available on your device.

The app is developed using Expo. Simple install all the dependecies and run the app with `expo start`. Note that Expo Go does not work with the MWA you must use a development build

## Testing

You can download the latest APK for testing in [releases](https://github.com/SC4RECOIN/StockPop/releases). This is just a beta release so expect some bugs and future changes.
